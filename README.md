Logic Circuit Solver (C++ Application)
A Logic Circuit Solver that evaluates digital logic circuits based on user-defined input. The application processes circuit descriptions in string format, supports various logic gates, and provides the final output while handling errors and variable inputs.

Key Features:
 Logic Circuit Evaluation: Parses and evaluates logic circuits using fundamental gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR).
 User-Defined Circuit Input: Accepts circuit descriptions as strings and processes them dynamically.
 Variable Support: Detects and replaces missing variables (e.g., a=1, b=0).
 Error Handling: Identifies incorrect gate names and missing inputs, providing clear error messages.
 Gate Usage Statistics: Counts the occurrences of each logic gate in the circuit.
 Testing & Validation: Successfully passed structured test cases on HackerRank.
